# Predict-LendingClub-s-Loan-Data

In this report, we attempt to predict the risk of the loan being default based on the past loan data. We obtained data from LendingClubâ€™s website(https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). We use loan data from year 2012-2014 as training and cross validation set and loan data from year 2015 as a testing set. We also compare our investment performance against the baseline algorithm. We found that, among multiple machine learning algorithms that we tried, Logistic Regression provided a reasonable trade-off performance, and a higher return than the naive loan picking strategy can be achieved.
